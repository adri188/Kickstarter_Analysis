# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.


## Analysis and Challenges



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

![Theater_Outcomes_vs_launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102937320/162600229-1e854514-0660-44a1-baa5-5bf02ecf98d5.png)

* Total Numbers of projects launched were higher between May-July, with signicant higher number of successful campaigns in May-Jun. 
* At the beggining and end of the year there were lower number of projects launched with lower successful campaign ratio compared to total projects 
* There is no significant correlation between failed initiatives and Launch date. 
* Louise should probably benefit from launching her campaign around this months. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102937320/162600238-c1a91eef-afc7-4900-ac77-f25b7f3c266f.png)

From this graph you can make a few interpretations 

* ~ 70% of Campaigns with goals less than 1000 and 1000-4999 were succesful 

* 50% of the Campaigns with goals Between 5000-25000 were succesful 

Using ttable to support this analysis better
* 70% of projects had goals <5000
* 76% of campaigns with goals < 1000 were succesful 
* A little over 50% of projects had campaigns goals between 1000-4999 with 73% of them being succesful

* Lousie goal of 10000 has a 50% chance of being succesful based on the data

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Some of the challenges that could be experienced
- Doubole counting data on formulas 
- not setting correct statements, not locking cells 
- while analyzing data and making statements there are more factor that should be taking into consideration. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?



### Initial Analysis

* Theater category for crowdfunding shows a higher number of successful campaigns

* Looking at the US specifically, we can also see Theater is the most common crowdfunding category with a 57% sucess rate vs total projects
* Need to look at more specifics to set the campaign for Fever for sucess 

* There is a significant correlation of succesful  campaigns vs launch date and it follows the trend when looking at theater. This play will potentially benefit if launched between May and June. 


* For Louise Interest on GB Market
1. Based on data for musicals we can see that half of the goals were less than 2000 and amounts pledged averaged ~1000. Furthermore we can see that 4000 is on the outlier range of amount pledged so the recommendation for Lousie is to try to produce for less than 4000.
