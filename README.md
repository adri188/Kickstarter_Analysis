* For Louise Interest on GB Market
1. Based on data for musicals we can see that half of the goals were less than 2000 and amounts pledged averaged ~1000. Furthermore we can see that 4000 is on the outlier range of amount pledged so the recommendation for Lousie is to try to produce for less than 4000.
