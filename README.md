# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

* For Louise Interest on GB Market
1. Based on data for musicals we can see that half of the goals were less than 2000 and amounts pledged averaged ~1000. Furthermore we can see that 4000 is on the outlier range of amount pledged so the recommendation for Lousie is to try to produce for less than 4000.
